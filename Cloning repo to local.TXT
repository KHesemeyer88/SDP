Cloning repo to local
- green code button -> copy https link
- create a new folder on your local computer
- Open VS code and a bash terminal or I used wsl
- (skip)Click on "start clone repo" on VS code open page to download extensions? (github codespaces, gitlens)
- "git clone copied https" in the terminal
- should see the folder on your local inside the folder you created
- open that folder
- download git, should see a prompt from vscode


go to the source control tab on the left, it will also prompt you to download git, then refresh
- can commit, change branch, pull, etc from here or the bash cmd line


commit changes then push then to github
- commit in source control, a commit message is required

pushing (pushes commits to the cloud)
- either "git push" or through source control

pulling
- git pull, grabs any changes from the cloud

right now we only have the main branch

GIT login on VScode
- when attemping to push or pull it will ask for github username and password, you can type it in there
- Can set it inside as a config  from the bash
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
- will be prompted to login through git
